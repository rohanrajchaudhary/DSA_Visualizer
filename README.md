In this project a dsa visualizer is present with a brief introduction.
# DSA Visualizer üåê

**Visualize Data Structures and Algorithms with ease!**  
A web-based interactive tool built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate common data structures and algorithms through animations.

## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive Visualizations** for:
  - Arrays & Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
  - Backtracking (N-Queens , Sudoku Solver)
  - Trees (Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
  - Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
  - Dynamic Programming (LCS , LIS , Knapsack ,Fibonacci)
  - Greedy Algorithm (Huffaman Coding , Activity Seliction)
  - Mathmatical Algorithm (GCD , Prime Factorization , Sieve of Eratosthenes) 
- **Step-by-Step Controls** (Play/Pause/Reset/Speed Adjustment)
- **Dynamic Code Snippets** to explain algorithm logic
- **Responsive Design** for seamless use on any device
- **Customizable Inputs** to test different scenarios
